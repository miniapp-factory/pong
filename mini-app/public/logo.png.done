A stylized logo for a classic Ping Pong game. The logo features a green square background representing the game board. In the center, a white square ball is positioned slightly above the horizontal center line. On the left side, a dark purple rectangle represents the player paddle, and on the right side, a similar dark purple rectangle represents the computer paddle. The ball is slightly offset to the right to suggest motion. The overall composition is balanced and simple, suitable for a small icon. The background should be a solid bright green, the paddles dark purple, the ball white, and the text “PONG” in a bold, modern font centered below the board. The logo should be clear and recognizable at small sizes.
